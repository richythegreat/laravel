    <h1>Reception</h1>
    <p>Film critic Kim Newman wrote: "The settings are good, the effects are above average, and the actors mostly do what they can â€“ but this is resolutely minor fare, and (length apart) among the least ambitious British horror films of recent years."[2]

        Bobby LePire of Film Threat praised the film's cast, practical effects and score, but criticized the plot and ending.[3]
        
        Sean Only of Starburst wrote that Keith "seems to have no idea how to script dramatic, coherent or even human-sounding dialogue, and some of the character choices and plot points often seem either baffling or like borderline continuity errors." Only praised the performances of Harris, Puckler and Selway, but wrote that the film is "so bogged down with incredibly amateurish performances that their efforts feel futile."[4]
        
        Doug Rice of WWNY-TV rated the film 1 star out of 5 and wrote that it "takes itself way too seriously" and "becomes a paint-by-numbers rehash of countless horror films with seemingly comparable plots that lead to the inevitable encounter with said killer." Rice also criticised the performances, the "bland" killer and the "uninspired and boring" kills.[5] </p>
